  Example of an express service working in Kubernetes
</p>

## üëÄ Motivation

The main idea of this repository is to show how we can create an express service using typescript and running it in Kubernetes. Note that this repository is not a template for starting new projects so we will not keep it up to date in terms of dependencies, vulnerabilities or new practices, if you are looking for a new template we recommend you to check the [project templates](#-project-templates) section.

## ü§© Project templates

Are you thinking in start new projects in nestjs, other frameworks or create a super fancy library? I recommend you to check the following templates I have been working on:

- [Template for new NestJS Services](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/nestjs-service-template)
- [Template for new Typescript Libraries](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/typescript-library-template)
- [Template for new Typescript Express Services](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/express-kubernetes-example)
- [Template for new GitHub Actions based on NodeJS](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/github-action-nodejs-template)

# üê≥ Starting the Kubernetes cluster

In this section we are going to explain how to start the Kubernetes cluster using docker-desktop and all the resources we have defined.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

First, let's install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/introduction/), that is a CLI for interacting with kubernetes, if you don't have it, and you are using a mac, you can install it using brew:

```shell
brew install kubectl
```

Now, we need to install [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) app. Once we have it, let's enable Kubernetes, we can do it by going to the settings and enabling the Kubernetes checkbox. For more information, you can check the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/).

## üöÄ Starting the cluster

Once docker desktop is running and Kubernetes is enabled, we need to build our docker image and create all the kubernetes resources we have configured, to do so we have automated the process with an script that you can run with:

```shell
make create-kubernetes-cluster
```

Now, you can get resources created in the cluster, for example, the pods, by running:

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

In case you want to delete all the cluster, you can run:

```shell
make delete-kubernetes-cluster
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developing

First, we will need to create our .env file, we can create a copy from the example one:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The project is fully dockerized üê≥, if we want to start the app in **development mode**, we just need to run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d my-service-dev
```

This development mode with work with **hot-reload** and exposing a **debug port**, the `9229`, so later we can connect from our editor to it.

Now, you should be able to start debugging configuring using your IDE. For example, if you are using vscode, you can create a `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following config:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach to docker",
      "restart": true,
      "port": 9229,
      "remoteRoot": "/app"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also, if you want to run the **production mode**, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d my-service-production
```

This service is providing just a health endpoint which you can call to verify the service is working as expected:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:3000/health
```

If you want to stop developing, you can stop the service running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
