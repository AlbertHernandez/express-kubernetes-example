  Example of an express service working in Kubernetes
</p>

## üëÄ Motivation

The main idea of this repository is to show how we can create an express service using typescript and running it in Kubernetes. Note that this repository is not a template for starting new projects so we will not keep it up to date in terms of dependencies, vulnerabilities or new practices, if you are looking for a new template we recommend you to check the [project templates](#-project-templates) section.

## ü§© Project templates

Are you thinking in start new projects in nestjs, other frameworks or create a super fancy library? I recommend you to check the following templates I have been working on:

- [Template for new NestJS Services](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/nestjs-service-template)
- [Template for new Typescript Libraries](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/typescript-library-template)
- [Template for new Typescript Express Services](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/express-kubernetes-example)
- [Template for new GitHub Actions based on NodeJS](https://github.com/AlbertHernandez/github-action-nodejs-template)

# üê≥ Starting the Kubernetes cluster

In this section we are going to explain how to start a Kubernetes cluster using minikube for local development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

First, we should make sure we have installed [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/introduction/) and [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Farm64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download) in our machine. If you are using a mac, you can install them using brew with `brew install kubectl` and `brew install minikube` respectively.

Also, you need to configure docker to work with minikube, you can do it running `eval $(minikube docker-env)`

## üöÄ Starting the cluster

```shell
minikube start
```

## ‚ö° Deploy kubernetes apps

We have automated the deployment of the kubernetes apps using an script, you can run it using:

```shell
make deploy-kubernetes-apps
```

Now, you can get resources created in the cluster, for example, the pods, by running:

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

## üõë Stop the cluster

When you have finished working with the cluster, you can stop it running:

```shell
minikube stop
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developing

First, we will need to create our .env file, we can create a copy from the example one:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The project is fully dockerized üê≥, if we want to start the app in **development mode**, we just need to run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d my-service-dev
```

This development mode with work with **hot-reload** and exposing a **debug port**, the `9229`, so later we can connect from our editor to it.

Now, you should be able to start debugging configuring using your IDE. For example, if you are using vscode, you can create a `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following config:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach to docker",
      "restart": true,
      "port": 9229,
      "remoteRoot": "/app"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also, if you want to run the **production mode**, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d my-service-production
```

This service is providing just a health endpoint which you can call to verify the service is working as expected:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:3000/health
```

If you want to stop developing, you can stop the service running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
